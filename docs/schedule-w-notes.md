- What is publishing?
      The Library Publishing Coalition defines library publishing at its website “as the set of activities led by...libraries to support the creation, dissemination, and curation of scholarly, creative, and/or educational works.” The statement makes explicit the distinctions that qualify these activities as publishing: “...library publishing requires a production process, presents original work not previously made available, and applies a level of certification to the content published, whether through peer review or extension of the institutional brand.” [1]
